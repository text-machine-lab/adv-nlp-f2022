            <h3>Course Description</h3>
            <p>

                This course is intended for students who have taken the Deep Learning for NLP class, have a deep curiosity about this field and wish to continue learning about the recent research and current developments in NLP.
            </p>


            <h3>Class format</h3>

Go around the room, introduce yourself (name, class standing, how you got into NLP, NLP projects you’ve done).
Next time: pick a topic, send me a bibliography (should end with 2022 papers), i will pick the paper for you to present
Next time: pick a topic you want to present on by Thu night, I will send out assignemnts for paper presentations by Fri night

PRESENTATIONS. Every week: by Thu night, post on slack a list of 3 papers you want to read, with an explanation (1 paragraph) of why you think this paper is worth reading.  I will write back and say which paper I’d like to you to present.  Everybody will present one paper each class.  
When presenting, think about whether there are any gaps or unanswered questions in the paper that you could answer in your project?

PROJECTS. Start thinking about a small project related to some of the papers you are reading. Is there a codebase to work from?  Is there data to work with? What experiments would you like to try?  What gap do you want to fill?

I assume you are here because you have a deep curiosity about this field. This should help you in this class

Work in pairs.

Project will be submitted as a public repo; call it adv-nlp-f2022




Deliverables
- Literature review
- Project (a trained, working model and a 3-page writeup of results + analysis)
- Submission: your public repo
- 1-2 people per project / per topic (2 is advised, talk to me if want to work solo)

First half of the class will be structured as follows:
- You will select a topic (out of the topics I listed)
- We will have a spreadsheet set up for each topic
- Every Thursday, you will add three papers to the spreadsheet that you would like to present (you can add more, but mark the ones you want to present the following Tuesday).
- Every Friday, I will look through the papers and mark the one I would like you to present.
- The papers should be from the last couple of years.  

Midway through semester:
3-page literature review for your topic
2-page project proposal, outlining up to three ideas (we will discuss and brainstorm on project ideas next class).
This will be due Fri after the last paper presentation.
