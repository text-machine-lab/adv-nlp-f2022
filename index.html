            <h4>Course description</h4>
            <p>

                This course is intended for students who have taken the Deep Learning for NLP class, have a deep curiosity about this field and wish to continue learning about the recent research and new developments in NLP.
                This is a fast-paced field, and in this course, we will read the latest papers on a number of current topics, and then the students will design and execute a small-scale research project related to their topic of choice.
            </p>


            <h4>Class format</h4>

<div>

<p>
    The course will be structured as a typical industry research internship in companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, MSR, IBM, etc.  You will have three months to develop and complete a project. Class meetings with your instructor and classmates will serve as your brainstorming source, help you design your experiments, interpret your results, etc.  You will help your classmates to do the same, learning about their project topics at the same time, as you would in a reading group.
</p>   

<p>
    Deliverables are:
<dl>
    <dt><b>Literature review for the topic of your choice.</b></dt> 
    <dd>This should be a 3-5 page writeup that presents an up-to-date review of the topic, including most recent publications. We can have 1-2 people per topic, but your literature review should be submitted individually.</dd>
    <dt><b>Research project</b></dt> 
    <dd>In most cases, this should be a trained, working model and a 3-5 page writeup of results + analysis. Projects should be done in pairs. If you would like to work solo, please talk to me.</dd>
    <dt><b>Weekly presentations</b></dt> 
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>[Weeks 2 – 7] Paper presentations – a 15-20 min paper presentation, with discussion</li>
            <li>[Weeks 8 – 13] Project progress presentations – review of results & brainstorming ideas</li>
    </dd>
</dl>
